I’ve finally started this blog, something I’ve been planning for years. Yet now, I find myself struggling to find my voice—the same issue that delayed me from starting it for so long. What should I write about? My passions? My work? Am I good enough?

There’s still a part of me that fears this might be the only post I ever write because it touches on the very struggle I’m facing. But I know I’m not alone—many people start blogs while wrestling with similar doubts. The truth is, I just need to start writing, and over time, my voice will emerge.

As I set up the website, configured the blog, and tweaked the template, I found myself once again wondering what my first post should be. All the fears that had held me back for years started to resurface. Eventually, I decided to write about exactly that—to remind myself of how I felt starting out, and hopefully, look back one day and see how much I’ve grown since then.

## So, why am I doing this?

My primary goal is to improve my writing skills. English is my second language, and writing has always been my weakest area—even in my native language. I often find it difficult to express my thoughts and ideas clearly, and this blog is a way to challenge myself to become a better communicator.

Secondly, I’ve always struggled with staying consistent on personal projects. Life tends to get in the way, forcing me to change plans and priorities. I dread starting new projects because they often end up unfinished. I’m hoping this blog will serve as a log to track what I’m doing and why I’m doing it, making it easier to pick things up again after life inevitably happens.

## What can you expect to see here?

Mostly personal projects. I’ll be talking about my home network, homelab, and some electronics projects I want to work on. I might occasionally write about work, but I don’t see myself posting tutorials or snippets, at least not for now. This space will be more of a reflective log, where I can express my thoughts, progress, and experiences. Hopefully, it will keep me accountable and motivated to continue growing both personally and professionally.

## Lastly, why am I making this post?

Beyond the reasons I’ve already mentioned, if you’re reading this, maybe it can inspire you to start your own journey. Or, at the very least, it will serve as a reminder of my own struggles—something we can all learn from.
